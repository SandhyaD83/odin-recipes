   <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>Curly Fries are a kind of fries characterized by their spring-like shape, being cut from whole potatoes using a specialized spiral slicer</p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li class="ing1">2 large potatoes</li>
    <li class="ing1">Vegetable oil</li>
    <li class="ing1">Kosher salt</li>
    <li class="ing1">1/2 cup allpurpose flour</li>
    <li class="ing1">2 tsp Paprika</li>
    <li class="ing1">1 tsp seasoned salt</li>
    <li class="ing1">1/2 tsp cayenne</li>
    <li class="ing1">ground black pepper</li>
   </ul>
   <ol>
       <li class="method1">Spiralize the potatoes into fries and soak in water in a container for 1 hour in the refrigerator.</li>
       <li class="method1">Combine the flour, paprika, seasoned salt, cayenne, some salt and pepper and 1 cup water in a large pitcher and pour into a large resealable plastic bag.</li>
       <li class="method1">Drain the fries and pat dry. Put them in the bag with the batter and massage to make sure they are coated thoroughly with it. Set aside for 30 minutes so the fries can absorb all the flavors.</li>
       <li class="method1">Heat about 3 inches of oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat to 365 degrees F.</li>
       <li class="method1">Cook the fries in batches until golden and crispy, about 2 minutes per batch. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate, sprinkle with salt and serve immediately.</li>
   </ol>
